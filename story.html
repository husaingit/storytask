                <h2>The <u><span id="animal"></span></u> and the <u><b><span
                                id="anotheranimal"></span></b></u></h2>

                <p>
                    A <u><b><span id="animal"> </span></b></u> was making fun of the <u><b><span id="anotheranimal"></span></b></u> one day for being slow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <u><b><span id="decision"></span></b></u> replied the <u><b><span
                                id="anotheranimal"></span></b></u>. "but i get there
                    <u><b><span id="speed"></span></b></u> than you think. I'll run a race and prove it."
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <u><b><span id="animal"></span></b></u> was so much <u><b><span id="adjective"></span></b></u> at the idea of running a race with the <u><span class="anotheranimal"></span></u>. but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <u><b><span id="onemore"></b></span></u>,
                    who has consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled,"
                    <u><b><span id="quotes"></span></b></u>".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <u><b><span id="animal"></span></b></u> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <u><b><span id="anotheranimal"></span></b></u> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <u><b><span id="anotheranimal"></span></b></u>.
                    he went off the course to practise <u><b><span id="verbs"></span></b></u> for
                    <u><b><span id="num"></span></b></u> hours until the <u><b><span
                                id="animal"></b></span></u> should catch up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <u><b><span id="anotheranimal"></span></b></u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <u><b><span id="anotheranimal"></span></b></u> was <u><b><span id="verbs"></span></b></u>. The
                    <u><b><span id="animal"></b></span></u> was so caught up in
                    <u><b><span id="verbs"></span></b></u>; and when at last he did stop, the <u><b><span id="anotheranimal"></span></b></u> was near the goal. The <u><b><span id="animal"></span></b></u> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake
                    the <u><b><span
                                id="anotheranimal"></span></b></u> in time.
